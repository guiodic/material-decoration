# material-decoration

Material-ish window decoration theme for KWin

### Locally Integrated Menu & Search

This hides the AppMenu icon button and draws the menu in the titlebar. It also
includes a search button to find actions. It works on both X11 and Wayland. On
Wayland, GTK apps don't export the menu. You need to start them with 
`GDK_BACKEND=x11` environment variable.

### Configuration

Make sure you add the AppMenu button in System Settings > Colors & Themes >
Window Decorations > Configure Titlebar Buttonsâ€¦. 

There, by clicking the pencil icon that is displayed when you select
the Material theme, you can modify various aspects of the decoration,
both in terms of appearance and behaviour. For example, you can transform
it into a hamburger menu, disable the search function, and even decide whether
to include inactive actions (those that are greyed out) in the search results.
